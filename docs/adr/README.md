# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Simulation Atlas project.
ADRs are written in the [MADR format](https://adr.github.io/madr/) (Markdown Any Decision Records, v3).

## Scope values

Each ADR carries a `scope:` frontmatter field indicating which part(s) of the system the decision affects:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `cross-cutting` | Applies to the whole project or multiple sub-packages |
| `backend` | `backend/` — FastAPI service |
| `frontend` | `frontend/` — React search portal |
| `toolkit` | `toolkit/` — Python ingestion library |
| `web-ide` | `web_ide/` — React Flow workflow editor |

A decision that affects multiple components lists all values, e.g. `scope: [backend, toolkit]`.

## Status values

- **proposed** — under discussion, not yet implemented
- **accepted** — decided and implemented
- **deprecated** — no longer relevant
- **superseded by [ADR-XXXX](XXXX-title.md)** — replaced by a newer decision

## Process

1. Copy the MADR template from ADR-0001.
2. Assign the next consecutive ID.
3. Fill in `status`, `date`, `deciders`, and `scope`.
4. Never edit an accepted ADR in place — create a superseding ADR instead.
